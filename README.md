WaterPots is a game in which you are given a number of pots with 4 random colours in each.
Depending on the difficulty of the level you get at least one empty pot.
The goal is to use the empty pots in order to move the colours so that there are no partial filled pots, and the full pots should only have one colour in each.
The intriguing part is that you can only pour a colour from a pot on the same colour in other pot.
